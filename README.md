# Diabetes Prediction

This project applies machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset containing medical information for classification.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🩺 Dataset Features

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic)
